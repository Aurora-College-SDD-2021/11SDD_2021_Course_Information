# Aurora College SDD Course Information

## The Big Plan

In this course we will project based learning approach presenting the theory and developing skills in the context of individual and group projects.

Each of these projects will be completed in either [repl.it](https://repl.it/team/ACCodeMonkeys) or [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/76028261-aurora-college-sdd-2022-classroom). We will introduce to both these platforms in the first few lessons but you can get more information in this [Introduction to Github](https://github.com/Aurora-College-SDD-2022/Course-Information/blob/main/docs/github_intro.md).
