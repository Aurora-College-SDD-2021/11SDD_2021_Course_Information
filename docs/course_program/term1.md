# Welcome to SDD

This page is a description of the fortnightly work including links to the recordings.

## Week 2

The first lessons will be an overview of the Course and the work environment, specifically repl.it, github and VS Code.

### Outcomes:

* create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account using your @education address
* I will use this account to invite you to the GitHub organisation [Aurora-College-SDD-2022](https://github.com/Aurora-College-SDD-2022). That's right 2022 because we will use this repository for the next 2 years.
* use your GitHub account to accept the invitation to the repl.it team [Aurora College SDD](https://repl.it/teams/join/jdmzgwpzujkutkljkjntpgnkqgakwqsh-ACCodeMonkeys)
* Familiarise yourself with important course information including:
    * Syllabus
    * Assessment Schedule
    * Course Specifications

* Make sure that you have [python (3.8 or greater)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-391/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed on both your Aurora laptop and the desktop you will be using during class (you may have to talk to your ACC to arrange the latter).

### Asynchronous work:
* Complete the Preliminary - Hello Turtles project in repl.it
